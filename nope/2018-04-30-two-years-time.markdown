You would embrace someone you care about without hesitation, thats just how it works. But the rejection stings like poison made from your worst fears, leaving you broken and hollow. You don't know how you will get back up, but, with the help of those closest to you, you manage to stand again. Sometimes confusion may arise from these situations, but it's vitally important to remember that it's okay. I've known you now for two years, and while that may not be a lifetime, I'll still remember you for the rest of my life.
