In general:
1. Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
2. Is it plugged in __and__ turned on?
3. Have you [googled](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+google "What is Google?") your problem?
4. Did you pay the internet/electricity bill?
5. Repeat troubleshooting steps as needed.

And, if you are doing this for somebody else:
6. Try everything.
7. Realize it was really simple.
8. Pretend it wasn't.
9. Be dissapointed in yourself.
