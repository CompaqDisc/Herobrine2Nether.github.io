I believe that __everyone__ deserves a second chance, because I was given that same kind of chance when I was at my worst.

I believe that __everyone__ deserves loving parents who will always be on your side, because I didn't know what that felt like for the longest time.

I believe that __everyone__ should be able to find acceptance, because, as unlikely as it was, I found it when I needed it most.

I believe that __everyone__ needs to find a circle of friends that help them to grow and learn, because I don't know if I would have come this far without mine.

I believe that God is real, becuase I've seen so many things happen in my life that I could explain no other way, and that __could not be simply coincidence__.

I believe that you can do anything you put your mind to, because I've __defeated the odds__ and have pointed my mind towards my dreams.

I believe that time is precious, because I've seen how it passes by, so __spend it wisely__.

I believe that __doing what you love__ will bring you happiness, because I've seen examples on either side.

I believe that you have to __have the right attitude__, because that got me through everything.

I beieve that __everything__ was worth it, because I'm here, __against all odds__.
