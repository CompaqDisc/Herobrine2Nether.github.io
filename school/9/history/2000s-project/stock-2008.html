							<h3>What Crash?</h3>
								<p>The crash started on October 9, 2007 with a closing 14,164.43 points. Less than 18 months later, it fell to 6,594.44 points, over a 50% loss.</p>
							<h3>Still Don't Get It?</h3>
								<p>In 2006, housing prices were falling, causing home-owners to stop paying off their loans. The government didn't think much of this, so the economy faltered. In 2007 the Federal Reserve found that banks didn't have enough easily sellable assets. So, they added more to the system while collecting the half paid loans as collateral. Economists worried that this trade-off would negatively affect the economy. The economy seemed to improve, for a while at least.</p>
								<p>In early 2008, the BEA (Bureau of Economic Analysis) announced that the economy had slowed recently, and that 17,000 jobs had been lost. Still, the Dow kept climbing. The Federal Reserve then came in to save a failing bank, Bear Sterns, the first casualty. The Dow dropped but seemed to recover, some say this rescue helped to prevent further decline. In July, the crisis had spread to government sponsored agencies Fanny Mae and Freddy Mac, which were both bailed by the Feds. The economy faltered, but seemed okay.</p>
								<p>In September, Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy, causing the Dow to lose 504.48 points.</p>
