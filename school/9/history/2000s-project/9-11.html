							<h3>What Happened</h3>
							<p>On September 11th, 2001 two planes were hijacked and flown into the World Trade Center, as a result 2,977 people had died, 2,996 including the hijackers. This was the biggest government attack since the Oklahoma City bombing of April 19th, 1995. Airport security as you can see is a lot different now because of the events that took place on September 11th, 2001, instead of leaving a half an hour to an hour before your flight, you now have to leave a couple hours before because of the airport security. Four planes were hijacked, two crashing into the World Trade Center another into the pentagon and the last one which was headed for the white house was brought down by a passenger. This day was critical to the United States past because of how many people had died and those who had sacrificed their lives. 8 months into George W. Bush's term 9/11 had happened and many people blamed him for what had happened and were scared from terrorists just walking into our country and causing more harm. 9/11 by far is and will be one of the biggest terrorist attacks in United States history. </p>
