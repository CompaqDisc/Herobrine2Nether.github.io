# In Summary
When I started taking Creative Writing, I didn’t anticipate much engagement or enjoyment. Alas, over these past few months, I’ve been able to express my emotions and desires, as well as some works of fiction, through pen and paper (or rather, the keyboard and screen). The style of writing that I happened to produce would best be described as a view into average high-schooler stressors: the opposite gender, how little time is left, future pursuits, faith, friends, and random odds and ends, along with little fiction pieces inspired by my favorite television shows.

I’ve learned more about myself in these past months than I could have ever anticipated, especially about dealing with emotions. By reading my work, you can take a glimpse into my life, and as an introvert, that kinda freaks me out (but whatever, cuz anonymity). I’ve learned that creativity isn’t just following the teacher’s examples and changing them slightly, but creativity __has to come from you__. In my case, being my life.

I hope that you enjoy!
