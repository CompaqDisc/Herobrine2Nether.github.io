Desire comes and goes like the rains, so I hear. As the raindrops fell fat and hard I observed a growing storm in the distance, a hurricane. I stared out from the balcony for who knows how long until I could feel myself being pulled by this unstoppable force. And then, through no real effort of my own, I was pulled in close. I feared, for I had become closer to anything then I ever had before. All of a sudden I was thrown into the eye of the beast. What I found was brief serenity, and then a feeling of distance most unexplicable, before I began to long for the exitement of the previous term.

When I'm with her, the world makes sense. When I'm away, everything becomes muddled and meaningless. With her, adventure and exitement reigns free, or rather, when she allows herself to be adventurous and exited. Because, to me, the truth of it is that she was like a cloud, one moment everything was calm and beautiful, but upon provocation she would become wound up and likely burn into your very soul with the storm brewing in her eyes.

It's a shame that this feeling is not replicated. So, to you, my perfect storm, farewell. Because I will not be dragged into the eye where potential for exitement simply isn't possible.
